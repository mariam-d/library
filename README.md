# library
python_Django_

LocalLibrary is the name of the website that the purpose of the website
is to provide an online catalog for a small local library,
where users can browse available books and manage their accounts.
we will define a simple browse-only library that library members can use to
find out what books are available. This allows us to explore the operations
that are common to almost every website: reading and displaying content from a database.
As we progress, the library example naturally extends to demonstrate more advanced Django features.
For example we can extend the library to allow users to reserve books, and use this to demonstrate
how to use forms, and support user authentication.
